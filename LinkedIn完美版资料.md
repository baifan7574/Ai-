## 二、关于我（About）- 完整专业版

### 完整内容（2000字符，LinkedIn限制）：

```
I provide comprehensive AI compliance, ethics review, and content safety assessment services for international tech companies entering the Chinese market. My unique value proposition combines three critical domains rarely found together: legal expertise, psychological insight, and technical implementation capabilities.

🎯 What I Do:

✅ Legal Compliance Review
• PIPL (Personal Information Protection Law) compliance assessment
• Data Security Law compliance analysis
• Cross-border data transfer regulations
• AI governance and regulatory framework review
• Risk mitigation strategies to prevent million-dollar fines

✅ AI Ethics & Cultural Sensitivity Assessment
• Ethical boundary evaluation for AI outputs
• Cultural appropriateness analysis for China market
• User psychological safety assessment
• Content moderation and safety review
• Emotional intelligence validation in AI interactions

✅ Data Quality Validation & Professional Review
• Data governance and privacy protection
• Content quality assurance
• Professional judgment on complex cases
• Technical accuracy validation
• Quality control beyond simple data entry

✅ Custom Consulting & Solutions
• China market entry strategic guidance
• Legal document review and translation
• Cross-cultural communication consulting
• Custom compliance solution development
• End-to-end risk mitigation support

💼 My Professional Background:

I bring together three critical domains that are rarely found together in a single consultant:

• Legal Expertise: Bachelor's Degree in Law from Fujian Normal University, with deep understanding of China's data protection laws, AI governance regulations, and commercial law frameworks. This enables me to identify compliance risks that could result in millions in fines and market exclusion.

• Psychological Insight: Certified Psychological Counselor with extensive experience in evaluating emotional intelligence, ethical boundaries, and user psychological safety in AI interactions. This allows me to assess the psychological and cultural implications of AI outputs that technical or legal consultants might miss.

• Technical Implementation: Full-Stack Developer (Python/Flask) with hands-on experience in AI integration, data processing systems, and custom compliance solution development. Unlike traditional law firms, I understand the technical implementation challenges and can help build practical solutions.

Additional Credentials:
• Teaching Certificate - Professional training and knowledge transfer
• Labor Relations Coordinator Certificate - Workplace compliance expertise
• National E-commerce Specialist Certificate - Digital business understanding
• Former Business & Technology Editor/Columnist - Professional writing and content quality assurance

💰 Pricing & Availability:

• Hourly Rate: $40/hour (exceptional value - see below)
• Project-Based: $2,000-$10,000+ (depending on scope and complexity)
• Monthly Retainer: $1,500-$4,000/month (for ongoing support)
• Flexible Structure: Accept both independent consulting projects and hourly remote work positions
• Remote Work: Available for global remote positions
• Immediate Start: Can begin immediately

🎁 Why I'm Worth $40/hour:

You're getting 3 professionals in one:
• Legal compliance expert (typically $100+/hour)
• Psychology content reviewer (typically $80+/hour)
• Technical AI reviewer (typically $60+/hour)

At $40/hour, you're getting $240/hour worth of expertise, plus risk prevention that could save you millions in compliance fines and reputation damage.

Unlike typical workers who only do data entry, I provide professional judgment on:
• Legal compliance risks
• Ethical boundaries and user safety
• Cultural appropriateness
• Technical accuracy

This means fewer errors, less rework, and better risk management for your business.

🌐 Specialization Areas:

• China market entry compliance (PIPL, Data Security Law, cross-border data transfer)
• AI ethics and cultural sensitivity assessment
• Data governance and privacy protection
• Content moderation and safety review
• Legal document translation and review
• Cross-cultural communication and localization
• Custom compliance solution development

💡 What Makes Me Different:

Traditional law firms understand regulations but may miss technical implementation challenges or psychological impact. Tech consultancies can build solutions but may not fully grasp legal implications or cultural sensitivities. Ethics consultants can identify moral issues but may lack legal or technical depth.

I combine all three perspectives, providing comprehensive solutions that address legal compliance, ethical alignment, and technical implementation in a single, integrated approach. This saves clients time, reduces coordination overhead, and ensures all aspects of their China market entry are aligned and optimized.

Hi [Name],

I saw your posting for [职位名称]. I'm interested, and I want to explain why I'm worth $40/hour.

My Background:

What This Means:
1. Risk Prevention: Legal background helps avoid compliance issues
2. Professional Judgment: Handle complex cases requiring legal/ethical expertise
